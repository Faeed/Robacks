Do you spend too many robux on catalog items? This extension is for you. Robacks is an extension developed by 0Techy to save you robux on any purchase you make from Roblox catalog. It can be any UGC item, Roblox's item or gamepass. Purchase through the site, and you'll get 40% of the cost back to the group you link the extension with. You get 10% cashback for gamepasses. However, you do not get any cashback from collectibles or limiteds.

## How does this work? 
This uses Roblox's API to send request with your game as sale location, making them think that the item was bought from your game. And for that, Roblox gives the developer AKA you - 40% of the commission. Cool right? This trick has been on Roblox forever but most people thought they have to join their game and purchase manually everytime to get cashback. This extension is here to save you some time.

## How do I get the robux? How do I set it up?
Installing the extension is the first task. Then head over to https://www.roblox.com/develop, press "Group Creations" and select a group you can access funds of. Now select a game from the group, or create a new one. Make sure the game is public and is available for anyone to play. Go to the game page, and copy it's ID from the URL. The numbers in the URL of the game page is the ID of the game. Once you have the ID, open the extension and you'll see an option where it says "Enter Game ID..". Paste your game ID in the box and link. It should show you the game ID you have linked then. And you are all set. Whenever you make a purchase, you'll get cashback in the group that the game is under. The robux will appear as pending and unpend within a week or two.

## Why should I trust you?
I'm aware that Roblox extensions nowadays are hard to trust since they can easily compromise your account. Chrome webstore has some good security measures to prevent that. But it's still bypassable. I've been on Roblox for 4 years and I have little to no experience about chrome extensions. I'm too stupid to script something like that. And I'm quite trustable in the Roblox community too. The extension was posted on the devforum for anyone to find it. Anyone can find my roblox account (https://www.roblox.com/users/468527306/profile). And I myself take responsiblities of all users of this extension. I'll never collect datas from player. The extensions also only whitelisted roblox.com & rbxcdn.com which are Roblox's API related. Which means I won't be able to collect any data in any way. The extension is open sourced for anyone to view and look for vulnerabilities.

## How do you profit from it?
Currently there's no way to profit from this. I'm planning on adding advertisement banner to the UIs soon. The only way I can earn a few bucks of it is the donation option.
